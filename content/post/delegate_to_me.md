I am SeongChan Lee, a CodeChain core developer. I've implemented the staking module of CodeChain, and [`ccstake`](https://github.com/CodeChain-io/codechain-stakeholder-sdk-js) CLI that you'll use to delegate to me.

You can find me in [GitHub](https://github.com/foriequal0) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/lee_seongchan)

My address is `cccqy5fd7umy66c65x69q4xrcw0czw9splpe5fp7xhs`. You can delegate your CCS to me with the following command:
```bash
ccstake delegate \
     --delegatee cccqy5fd7umy66c65x69q4xrcw0czw9splpe5fp7xhs \
     --account <your account> \
     --quantity <quantity of CCS to delegate>
```
